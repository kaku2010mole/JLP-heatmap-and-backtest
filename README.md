# JLP-heatmap-and-backtest
Example usage:

In terminal, heatmap can be generated by,

1. Use this order to start the data fetcher and save snapshots


node "loop_every_one_minute.mjs"


Then it will start to fetch on chain data, and store them in data-sol_snapshots in sol_positions_log.csv (UTC time in this file). New data will be directly added below existing data.

RPC used here is my private free node. We can change it to company's RPC for more stable experience.


2. Use this order to generate the heatmap from recent snapshots


python3 timeseries_liq_heatmap.py \
  --folder data-sol_snapshots \
  --hours 72 \
  --bin 0.1 \
  --pmin 170 \
  --pmax 220 \
  --out heatmap_1min.png


Factors here can be adjusted. 

--hours: how many hours back from now the heatmap spans (it begins at now âˆ’ hours).

--pmin / --pmax: lower and upper bounds of the price axis.



Notes: This is already a sol_positions_log.csv file in data-sol_snapshots for reference.
